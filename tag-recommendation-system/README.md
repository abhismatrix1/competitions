### Tag Recommendation System (supervised learning)
hackerearth deep learning #4 challenge

#### Problem Statement
HackerEarth wants to improve its customer experience by suggesting tags for any idea submitted by a participant for a given hackathon. Currently, tags can only be manually added by a participant. HackerEarth wants to automate this process with the help of machine learning. To help the machine learning community grow and enhance its skills by working on real-world problems, HackerEarth challenges all the machine learning developers to build a model that can predict or generate tags relevant to the idea/ article submitted by a participant.

You are provided with approximately 1 million technology-related articles mapped to relevant tags. You need to build a model that can generate relevant tags from the given set of articles.

#### Data Description

The dataset consists of ‘train.csv ’, ‘test.csv’ and ‘sample_submission.csv’. Description of the columns in the dataset is given below:

Variable Description

id Unique id for each article

title

Title of the article

tags
